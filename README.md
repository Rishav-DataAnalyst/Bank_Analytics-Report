Bank_Analytics-Report
This project involves analyzing a comprehensive dataset of loan records and presenting the insights using an interactive dashboard built in Power BI. The dataset was prepared as a master sheet in Excel, containing multiple key attributes related to loans, such as loan amount, interest rates, loan categories, verification status, and more.
key feature:-
1)Loan Overview:
Total Loan Applications: 40K

Funded Amount: 435M
Revolving Balance: 532M
Total Payments Received: 482.7M
Sum of Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): 52,883
Year-wise Loan Amount: A bar chart displaying loan amount distribution across different years from 1899 to 2016.
2)Verification Status Breakdown:
Distribution of loans by verification status (Verified, Not Verified, Source Verified).
3)Homeownership Analysis:
Sum of Loan Amount by Homeownership (Mortgage vs. Rent).
4)Completion and Default Analysis:
Loan Completers:
Loan Completion Rate: 85.83%
Total Loan Applications: 34K
Funded Amount: 369M
Loan Amount Received: 444M
Loan Defaulters:
Default Rate: 14.17%
Total Applications: 6K
Funded Amount: 66M
Amount Received: 38M
The Loan Data Analysis Dashboard provides an insightful summary of the loan dataset, enabling efficient management and analysis of the information. Here's how the dashboard helps in managing the dataset effectively:

1. Comprehensive Overview of Key Metrics
The dashboard provides a clear overview of critical metrics such as the total number of loan applications (40K), the sum of the loan amount (446M), the amount funded (435M), and the total payments received (482.7M). This summary at the top of the dashboard allows quick evaluation of the loan portfolio.
2. Year-wise Loan Distribution
A bar chart that shows the loan amount by year helps in identifying trends over time. The insights derived from this can help in understanding the business growth, peak periods, and changes in borrower behavior.
3. Verification Status Analysis
The pie chart segmenting loans by verification status (Verified, Not Verified, Source Verified) provides a clear understanding of how much of the loan volume has been verified, enabling risk assessment based on verification processes. Itâ€™s crucial for identifying potential areas that require tighter income verification checks.
4. Homeownership Analysis
The breakdown of loan amounts based on homeownership (e.g., Mortgage, Rent) helps in understanding the relationship between homeownership and borrowing habits. This insight can be useful for adjusting loan terms or interest rates depending on the type of borrower.
5. Loan Completion vs. Default Rates
The dashboard helps differentiate between successful loans and defaults:
Loan Completers:
The 85.83% completion rate suggests a healthy portfolio, and metrics like the number of completed applications (34K) and the funded amount (369M) provide deeper insights.
Loan Defaulters:
The 14.17% default rate is highlighted to understand risk factors, and the data about defaulted applications (6K) and the associated funded amount (66M) helps in evaluating the impact of defaulters on the overall loan portfolio.
6. Interactive Filtering Capabilities
Users can interact with filters for State, Grade, and Purpose to refine the data view. This allows for detailed segmentation and analysis based on geographic location, loan grading, and the intended purpose of the loan. It makes it easier to manage specific portions of the dataset and understand how different groups are performing.
7. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The use of KPIs at the top of the dashboard provides a quick snapshot of the loan performance metrics, allowing stakeholders to assess the portfolio health and quickly identify areas that need attention.
8. Geographical and Grade-Based Insights
By allowing users to filter by State and Grade, the dashboard provides insights into geographical differences in loan behavior and the performance of various risk grades. This helps in making more informed decisions regarding regional strategies and assessing risk according to loan grading.
Summary
The dashboard makes the loan data manageable by summarizing large amounts of data into meaningful visualizations that can be easily understood and acted upon. The combination of high-level metrics, detailed breakdowns, and interactive filtering helps in gaining both broad and deep insights into the loan portfolio. This approach ensures efficient data management, better risk assessment, and targeted decision-making for improved lending practices.
